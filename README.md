Your task will be to prepare simple landing page based on designer's prototype. Goal is to show off your ability to work with responsive design, fetch the data from API endpoint and render them on the page. We will mainly focus on your code style, atomic approach for writing components and respect for designer's demands at the same time.

Provided data from https://fakestoreapi.com/products consists of objects with some key-value pairs about clothes, jewelry, etc. Your job is to render and sort these products based on their rating and give them appropriate image by their category. You can download these images here in Figma.
